# Portable-Resonance-Pyramid-for-Biofield-Balancing
portable pyramid structure designed to balance the bio-energy field in confined spaces (e.g., condominiums, tents). The device utilizes geometric resonance principles based on the Golden Ratio to collect energy from the atmosphere and the Earth for water structuring and cellular balancing. It emphasizes safety and observable results.
