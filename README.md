​1. Executive Summary
​This proposal outlines the development and technical specifications of a portable pyramid structure designed to balance the bio-energy field in confined spaces (e.g., condominiums, tents). The device utilizes geometric resonance principles based on the Golden Ratio to collect energy from the atmosphere and the Earth for water structuring and cellular balancing. It emphasizes safety and observable results for general users.

​2. Device Technical Specifications
​2.1 Geometry
​Principle: Golden Ratio (\phi) based on Euclid's geometric definition is the core design principle for maximum resonance [1].
​Shape: Square Pyramid.
​Base Angle: Must be angled at 51° 50' 40" to the ground [1].
​Precision: Maximum tolerance not to exceed \pm0.1 mm.
​2.2 Structure Material
​Material: Clear Acrylic or High-Grade Beech Wood.
​Constraint: NO METALS allowed in the structure to prevent the Faraday Cage Effect, which blocks resonance energy [2].
​2.3 Apex Receiver
​Material: Synthetic Diamond.
​Cut: Brilliant Cut for maximum energy refraction (Total Internal Reflection) [3].
​Installation: Secured with a clear acrylic insulator at the pyramid's apex.
​Academic Justification: Diamond has the highest refractive index (\approx 2.417), allowing for maximum energy concentration. The Brilliant Cut serves to "trap" energy through total internal reflection before directing it down the waveguide cable [3].
​2.4 Vortex Point (8-Direction Focusing Plate)
​Material: Acrylic or High-Density Wood (Non-conductive).
​Shape: Octagonal Plate with 8 radial grooves, 2 mm deep, leading to the center [4].
​Installation Position: 1/3 of the height from the base (or 2/3 from the apex).
​Connection: Plate center secured to the waveguide cable descending from the apex.
​Academic Justification: The 8 radial grooves simulate Vortex Dynamics behavior to distribute energy from the center stably and equally throughout the structure [4].
​2.5 Waveguide Cable
​Type: Special non-metallic insulated waveguide cable.
​Properties: Non-conductive and does not interfere with Schumann resonance [5].
​2.6 Output Terminal
​Material: Clear Quartz Sphere for indirect contact.
​Shape: Sphere for omnidirectional energy radiation [6].

​3. Product Dimensions Examples
​Note: The dimensions below are examples for standard component manufacturing. Producers may adjust sizes as long as the 51° 50' 40" base angle is maintained according to the Golden Ratio.
​3.1 Model P-1 (Portable & Foldable)
​Base Dimensions (Example): 15 x 15 cm.
​Height (Approximate): ~9.5 cm.
​Usage: Portable/General use.
​3.2 Model P-2 (Hanging)
​Base Dimensions (Example): 30 x 30 cm.
​Height (Approximate): ~19 cm.
​Usage: Hanging/Spacious areas.
​3.3 Model P-3 (Compact Travel)
​Base Dimensions (Example): 20 x 20 cm.
​Height (Approximate): ~12.7 cm.
​Usage: Desktop.

​4. Standard Manual Protocols
​4.1 Setup
​Fully unfold the pyramid frame until it locks into place (verify equal base proportions).
​Install the 8-direction focusing plate at the Vortex point (1/3 of the height from the base).
​Ensure the synthetic diamond at the apex is securely fastened.
​4.2 Preparation
​Cleanliness and Calm: Users should cleanse their body (shower/wash hands) and calm their mind before use to maximize energy absorption efficiency [7].
​Metal Caution: It is recommended to remove all metal jewelry from the body during use to prevent blocking or interfering with the energy field [2].
​4.3 Intention Setting and Water Balancing Method
​Intention Setting: Users must focus their mind and set an intention for energy reception to balance [8].
​Sample Intention: "With the principle of resonance based on the golden ratio, I intend for natural energy to flow through this pyramid into the water molecules, to organize the energy structure of my body and mind, aligning with natural balance and achieving perfect health."
​Water Balancing Usage (Indirect Method):
​Place the quartz sphere at the bottom of a glass container filled with water (or beside the water bottle) to transfer energy through the container material into the water molecules.
​Do not directly submerge the quartz sphere into drinking water to prevent material contamination and avoid skin contact infections [6].
​Use one hand to touch the quartz sphere and the other hand to hold the water container to complete the energy circuit [9].
​4.4 7-Day Protocol
​Repeat the preparation and water balancing steps for 7 consecutive days, ensuring the pyramid base is aligned with magnetic North for maximum efficiency [10].

​5. Justification of 7-Day Protocol
​The 7-day duration is based on biophysical principles:
​a) Biological Cycle: The human body requires time to adjust its bio-energy field (Biofield) to align with a new resonance frequency. Bioenergetic studies indicate that a 7-day cycle is sufficient to initiate cellular balancing before noticeable results occur [9, 10].
​b) Natural and Energy Cycles: The 7-day period aligns with natural cycles that influence human mood and energy levels. Continuous usage helps the body memorize and stabilize in a state of balance better than short-term usage.

​6. Expected Outcomes for Users
​Users may observe the following results from energy balancing:
​Mental: Improved Mental Clarity and entry into Deep Relaxation.
​Physical: Increased Vitality and faster recovery from fatigue.

​9. Production & Installation Guide (Golden Ratio)
​9.1 Material Cutting Guide
​Base Side Length: Defined by model (e.g., 15 cm).
​Slant Edge Length: 0.809 x Base Side Length.
​Pyramid Height: 0.618 x Base Side Length.
​9.2 Focusing Plate Installation Manual
​Installation Position: Must be installed at 1/3 of the pyramid's height, measured from the base up towards the Apex.
​Plate Securing: Place the octagonal plate at the 1/3 height level, securing it to the four main frame pillars using clear acrylic anchors.
​Cable Connection: Connect the waveguide cable from the apex diamond down to the center of the octagonal plate. The cable must be perfectly centered.
​Sphere Installation: Connect the quartz sphere to the end of the waveguide cable hanging from the plate center.
​9.3 Precautions
​NO METAL MATERIALS allowed for securing the octagonal plate or for the pyramid frame, as metal conducts electricity and acts as a Faraday Cage, blocking natural resonance energy [2].
​Ensure all 8 radial grooves on the octagonal plate are aligned radially with the frame pillars.
​The octagonal plate must be perfectly horizontal (Horizontal Alignment).
